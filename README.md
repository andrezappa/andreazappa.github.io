This website has the purpose to show to a potentially interested public my characteristics and what I can do, thanks to the skills and projects that are shown on the page respectively in "Skills" and "Projects" section.

In addition, you can find in my website a little presentaion of me, in "About Me" section and a form to contact me for any reason, in the homonymous "Contact Me" section.

For create this website I've used different technologies:
* **Visual Studio Code** as editor for writing code; 
* **HTML** for realized the page's structure;
* **CSS** to define the style of the page; 
* **Font Awesome** for the icons.

At the least I've used **Formspree** for receiving emails.
## Open Graph and SEO
To improve SEO, I finally introduced the Open Graph tag, that is a protocol that allows you to indicate to social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter and Linkedin for example, what information is shown when someone shares a link from your site.
